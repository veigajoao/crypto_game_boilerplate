# crypto_game_boilerplate

This boilerplate contract code will serve the purpose of developing and testing different implementations pf crypto games in ethereum/binance smart chain applications.

# game project

The game project involves:

1. Creation of ERC20 token (game token)
2. Creation of ERC721 NFTs as game chars
3. Creation of ERC20 tokens as game char packages (which randomly output an NFT character)
4. Game contract
 
 ...The contract will have public functions that take a nft, evaluate some require() needs - such as 
 minimum wait time between games, char attributes, etc. and output new tokens for the player

5. Marketplace contract
6. locked wallets contracts

 ...Locked wallets will be used to hold reserved funds for devs, investors, vendors, etc.
