# crypto_game_boilerplate

This boilerplate contract code will serve the purpose of developing and testing different implementations pf crypto games in ethereum/binance smart chain applications.

# game project

The game project involves:

1. Creation of ERC20 token (game token) - Done
2. Creation of ERC721 NFTs as game chars - Partially done (must implement randomness of char generation with different box prices and probabilities) (must implement randomness of char types and attributes)
3. Game contract
 
 The contract will have public functions that take a nft, evaluate some require() needs - such as 
 minimum wait time between games, char attributes, etc. and output new tokens for the player

4. Marketplace contract
5. locked wallets contracts

 Locked wallets will be used to hold reserved funds for devs, investors, vendors, etc.
