# crypto_game_boilerplate

This boilerplate contract code will serve the purpose of developing and testing different implementations pf crypto games in ethereum/binance smart chain applications.

# game project

The game project involves:

1. Creation of ERC20 token (game token) - Done
2. Creation of ERC721 NFTs as game chars - Done
3. Game contract - Done
 
 The contract will have public functions that take a nft, evaluate some require() needs - such as 
 minimum wait time between games, char attributes, etc. and output new tokens for the player

4. Marketplace contract - pending will not be prioritised
5. locked wallets contracts - Done (will use standard "@openzeppelin/contracts/finance/VestingWallet.sol")

 Locked wallets will be used to hold reserved funds for devs, investors, vendors, etc.

6. ICO contracts - pending (2 contracts - 1 buying early boxes - 2 buying early tokens)
