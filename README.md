# crypto_game_boilerplate

This boilerplate contract code will serve the purpose of developing and testing different implementations pf crypto games in ethereum/binance smart chain applications.

# game project

The game project involves:

1. Creation of ERC20 token (game token) - Done
2. Creation of ERC721 NFTs as game chars - Done
3. Game contract - Done
 
 The contract will have public functions that take a nft, evaluate some require() needs - such as 
 minimum wait time between games, char attributes, etc. and output new tokens for the player

4. Marketplace contract - pending will not be prioritised
5. locked wallets contracts - Done

6. ICO contracts - pending (2 contracts - 1 buying early boxes - 2 buying early tokens)

# Code organization

The code has been divided into 3 main folders:

1. Contracts - holds source code for smart contracts
2. test - holds unit testing and functional testing code for the smart contracts in a Ganache Ethereum Network
3. deployment - holds scripts for actually deploying the contracts to live nets (test or main)

The JSON-RPC endpoint for the deployment network, private keys and current live contracts addresses are to be loaded as environment variables when running the scripts

# Mainnet contracts

Contracts will be deployed to Binance Smart Chain Mainnet
